This City Code shall be cited as Moore City Code or “MCC” as an acronym.

MCC references found within the code maintain a structure by subject matter using a decimal and hyphenated numbering system which identifies the chapter and section (<strong>example: 1-101.01</strong>). This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching and/or referencing the Municipal Code, and to assist in subsequent codification is new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code.</p><ul><li>The first number in the sequence designates the <strong>PART</strong> level
</li><li>The second series of numbers (<strong>1</strong>-101) designates the <strong>CHAPTER</strong> level
</li><li>The third series of numbers (1-<strong>101</strong>) designates the <strong>Section</strong> level
</li><li>If a fourth series exists comprising letters or numbers beyond the section level, it designates a <strong>Subsection</strong> level.
</li></ul><p>To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the legislation herein, the following list order (or pattern of ascending alphanumeric characters) is used: <strong>(a), (1), a, 1, i</strong>. Drafting legislation with this list order better reconciles the content in local software and hard copies, with the content in this online code. The legislative history beneath a legislation’s content identifies the specific legal sources, and may be provided to substantiate the online code.</p><p>The Municipal Code is supplemented from time­ to ­time with amendments and additions made by Moore, Oklahoma. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been adopted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Corporation, provides a searchable database of the Municipal Code for easy reference and convenience.

NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.

It also elevates the potential for the spread of disease in people and companion animals. In addition, it is the intent of this section to protect the welfare of the waterfowl and wild animals themselves. Wildlife studies have shown that feeding waterfowl and other wild animals can interrupt their normal migration patterns, can make them more aggressive in demanding food, cause nutritional problems, expose them and our citizens to danger by eliminating the animals’ natural fear of predators, and promote the spread of diseases and disease-carrying parasites.&nbsp;</li><li class="">Definitions.

Such appointment in writing is evidence of the roofing contractor's consent that any such process against the contractor which is served upon the secretary of state shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served upon the contractor personally within the state. Registered foreign corporations, registered foreign limited liability companies, foreign limited liability partnerships and foreign limited partnerships entitled to do business in the state having a current registered agent and registered address on file in the office of the secretary of state need not appoint the secretary of state as agent for service of process under this section.

The secretary of state shall keep a record of all process served upon the secretary of state under this section, showing the day and hour of service. Whenever service of process was made under this section, the court, before entering a default judgment, or at any stage of the proceeding, may order such continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant contractor reasonable opportunity to defend any action pending against the defendant contractor.</p><p>(Code 1999, § 5-1012; Ord.

It is normally a relatively shallow, diked structure and may receive either raw or pretreated wastes. The satisfactory operation of the process depends upon the growth of algae and like organisms for the production of oxygen through photosynthesis; therefore, conditions must be maintained which are conducive to the growth of algae, such as proper water depth, sufficient dissolved oxygen, and maximum penetration of sunlight. 
</li><li><em>Construction.</em> 
<ol><li>No waste stabilization lagoons shall be installed or constructed within the limits of the city until and unless the city council has approved the proposal for such construction and installation. The review herein contemplated to be made by the council shall consist of, but not necessarily limited to, the following matters: 
<ol><li>The location of the lagoon site; 
</li><li>Its proximity to residential areas; 
</li><li>A consideration of the effect on the surrounding area if the lagoon breaks or its proper operation is interrupted for any cause; 
</li><li>The effect of such lagoon on surrounding property values; 
</li><li>If the lagoon is not a full retention lagoon, the direction of flow and ultimate disposition of the effluent from overflow. 
</li></ol></li><li>If city council approves a proposed waste stabilization lagoon, construction and installation shall comply with the state department of environmental quality regulations.

The city may determine that a building is unsecured and order that such building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for in this section even though such building has not been declared by city to be dilapidated.</p><ol><li>Before the city orders such action, at least ten days' notice that such unsecured building is to be boarded and secured shall be given by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as provided in section 8-303. At the time of mailing of notice to any property owners or mortgage holders, the city clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of the mailing and the name and address of the mailee. A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the property to be affected. However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the property or by publication as defined in 11 O.S. § 1-102. Such notice shall be published one time, not less than ten days prior to any hearing or action by the city pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the administrative officer anticipates summary abatement of a nuisance in accordance with the provisions of this section, the notice shall state that: any subsequent need for boarding and securing the building within a six-month period after the initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the city, that the costs of such boarding and securing shall be assessed against the owner, and that a lien may be imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further prior notice to the property owners or mortgage holders; 
</li><li>The owner of the property may give his written consent to the city authorizing the boarding and securing of such unsecured building and to the payment of any costs incurred thereby. By giving the written consent, the owner waives his right to a hearing as provided in this section; 
</li><li>If the property owner does not give his written consent to such actions, a hearing may be held by the administrative officer to determine whether the boarding and securing would promote and benefit the public health, safety or welfare. Such hearing may be held in conjunction with a hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on the premises of such unsecured building held pursuant to this Code. In making such determination, the administrative officer shall apply the following standard: the administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such building less available for transient occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such building, or decrease the hazard that such building would constitute an attractive nuisance to children. Upon making such a determination, the administrative officer may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured building; 
</li><li>After the administrative officer orders the boarding and securing of such unsecured building, the city clerk shall immediately file a notice of unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the property, stating the findings of the city at the hearing at which the building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the city claims a lien on the property for the costs of boarding and securing the building and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date of filing the notice; 
</li><li>Pursuant to the order of the administrative officer, the agents of the city are granted the right of entry on the property for the performance of the boarding and securing of such building and for the performance of all necessary duties as a governmental function of the city; 
</li><li>After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the administrative officer shall determine the actual costs of such actions and any other expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith, including the cost of the notice and mailing. The city clerk shall forward a statement of the actual costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured building and a demand for payment of such costs by mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as provided in section 8-303. At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owners or mortgage holders, the city clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee; 
</li><li>If the city boards and secures any unsecured building, the cost to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, materials and equipment required for the performance of such actions. If such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder; 
</li><li>When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured building is not made within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of the property, the city clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount of the costs to the county treasurer of the county in which the property is located. The costs shall be levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law. Until fully paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be the personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the notice of unsecured building and lien is filed with the county clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles and liens against the property, and shall continue until the costs and interest are fully paid. At any time prior to collection as provided herein, the city may pursue any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest thereon, including an action in personam against the property owner and an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral interest if severed from the surface owner shall not be subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section. Upon receipt of payment in full, the city clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of such payment and direct discharge of the lien; 
</li><li>An appeal may be taken from the decision of the administrative officer to the city council if filed in writing with the city clerk within ten days after the administrative order is rendered; 
</li><li>If the city causes a structure to be boarded and secured, in accordance with the procedures provided for in this section, any subsequent need for boarding and securing the property within a six-month period may be declared a nuisance and may be summarily abated without prior notice to the property owner. At the time of such summary abatement, the city clerk shall notify the property owner of the boarding and securing and of the costs thereof. The notice shall state that the property owner may request a hearing within ten days from the date of mailing the notice. The notice and hearing shall be as provided in this section. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing, the cost of such abatement shall be determined and collected as provided in this section. This section shall not apply if the records of the county clerk show that the property was transferred after notice was given pursuant to this section.

Otherwise, the dealer shall not release or dispose of the property except pursuant to a court order or the expiration of the holding period, including all extensions.

The dealer shall hold such property until receiving notice of the disposition of the case from the district attorney's office. The district attorney's office shall notify the dealer in writing within 15 days of the disposition of the case. Willful noncompliance of a dealer to a written hold order shall be cause for the dealer's license to either be suspended or revoked. A hold order may be released prior to the expiration of any 30-day holding period by written release from the agency placing the initial hold order.

</li><li>No person shall use any street, alley, public way, park or other property owned or controlled by the city, except those places specifically designed and intended for such use, for the purpose of holding, conducting, causing or participating in any parade, street fair, street dance, carnival, assemblage or activity of any nature which may cause the disturbance or interference of the normal and ordinary use of the property by other persons, without first having obtained a permit for such purpose. The permits may be granted by the city manager under such conditions as deemed appropriate. 
</li><li>Permits shall not be required under this section in the case of construction or repairs to or within any such street or property, provided all other requirements of this Code are complied with. 
</li><li>Not less than two weeks prior to the closing or use of a street or property for a parade, an application shall be submitted by the party to the city. The time requirements may be waived by the city manager at his discretion if sufficient time exists for the proper review of the application as herein provided. The application shall be submitted upon a form prescribed by the city. The application shall provide such other information as requested. 
</li><li>The city manager shall issue a permit as provided for hereunder when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, he finds that: 
<ol><li>The conduct of the parade will not substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route; 
</li><li>The conduct of the parade will not require the diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection to the city; 
</li><li>The conduct of such parade will not require the diversion of so great a number of ambulances as to prevent normal ambulance service to portions of the city other than that to be occupied by the proposed line of march and areas contiguous thereto; 
</li><li>The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at assembly points of the parade will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such assembly areas; 
</li><li>The conduct of such parade will not interfere with the movement of firefighting equipment en route to a fire; 
</li><li>The conduct of the parade is not reasonably likely to cause injury to persons or property, to provoke disorderly conduct or create a disturbance; and 
</li><li>The parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays en route. 
</li></ol></li><li>The city manager, in such cases as shall be determined in his discretion, may require as a condition to the issuance of a permit herein such insurance or bond holding the city harmless from any and all liability for injury or damage of any kind whatsoever occurring during such activity covered by the permit. 
</li><li>Without regard to the above provision of this section, the city manager, from his consideration of available, appropriate and necessary information, shall deny the application for a permit provided for by this section when, from this information, he has reason to believe that any contemplated advocacy at the proposed event will be directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and will likely incite or produce such action. 
</li><li>The city manager, in denying an application for a parade permit, may authorize the conduct of the parade on a date, at a time or over a route different from that named by the applicant. An applicant desiring to accept an alternate permit shall so indicate within five days after notice of the action of the city manager. An alternate parade permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a parade permit under this section. 
</li><li>As used in this section, the term "special event' means any activity which occurs upon private or public property that (1) may reasonably affect the ordinary use of public streets, rights-of-way or sidewalks, or (2) include the erection of any temporary structure (inflatables/bouncy toys, or tents or canopies larger than 400 square feet, etc.) where the public is invited, or (3) include the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages on a premises not currently licensed by the state for the sale or consumption of alcohol on the premises where the public is invited. This includes, but is not limited to, fairs, festivals, foot races, bike races, block parties, grand opening celebrations, and other temporary assemblages of people. The term "expressive special event" means a special event as defined above, organized or conducted solely or primarily for the purpose of engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The term "spontaneous expressive event" shall mean an expressive special event that is occasioned by news, affairs, or circumstances coming into public knowledge less than five days prior to the date of such event. 
<ol><li>No person, organization, business or corporation shall conduct any type of special event as defined above without a special event permit from the city. 
</li><li>An application for a special event shall be submitted to the city no later than 30 days prior to the proposed event. In the event of an expressive special event, the application must be submitted within five business days prior to the proposed event. In the event of a spontaneous expressive event, the event must not present a substantial safety or traffic hazard and must not unduly impede, obstruct, impair or interfere with the public's use of the street or other public property, the operation of emergency vehicles, the provision of the city services, or any lawful competing use of the location where the event is located. If any portion of the preceding cannot be met, then the event organizer must make a diligent and good faith effort to relocate the event to another location. If the location cannot be relocated due to the special communicative value of the event's location or the unavailability of another location, then the chief of police shall take appropriate action to the extent reasonably necessary to eliminate the hazard, risk, interference, or impairment; provided however, that the chief of police shall not order the area cleared or the cessation of spontaneous expressive activities unless reasonably necessary to avoid imminent danger to person or property. Applicants may file application as early as desired by the applicant. 
</li><li>Reasons for denial of a special events permit include, but are not limited to, the event will disrupt traffic within the city beyond practical solution; will interfere with access to fire stations and the fire hydrants; the location of the special event will cause undue hardship to adjacent businesses or residents; the event would require the diversion of so many city, public safety and/or and public works employees that allowing the event would unreasonably deny service to the remainder of the city; and the application contains incomplete or false information. 
</li><li>This section shall not be construed as imposing upon the city or its officials or employees any liability or responsibility for any injury or damages to any person in any way connected to the use for which permits have been issued. The city and its officials and employees shall not be deemed to have assumed any liability or responsibility by reasons of inspections performed, the issuance of any permit or the approval of any use of the right-of-way. 
</li><li>A special event permit may be issued only after adequate waste disposal facilities and toilet facilities as necessary have been identified and obtained by the permittee. The permittee will clean their property, city property and any adjacent properties of trash, rubbish, or debris generated by the special event, returning it to its pre-event condition within 24 hours of the conclusion of the event. If the permittee fails to clean up such refuse, such clean up shall be as required by law or other sections of this Code and the costs charged to the permittee. 
</li><li>The permittee shall obtain other permits that may be required from other jurisdictions for this special event.

The level so read is designated as dB(A) or dBA. <br><em><br>Construction</em> means any site preparation, assembly, erection, substantial repair, alteration, or similar action, excluding demolition, for or of public or private rights-of-way, structures, utilities or similar property. <br><em><br>Continuous sound</em> means any sound, essentially without interruption, which exists for a period of six minutes or more. <br><em><br>Decibel (dB)</em> means a unit for measuring the volume of a sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter), denoted as dB. <br><em><br>Demolition</em> means any dismantling, intentional destruction or removal of structures, utilities, public or private right-of-way surfaces, or similar property. <br><em><br>Device</em> means any mechanical object or piece intended to produce, or which produces, the resultant effect objectively sought when operated or used. <br><em><br>Emergency</em> means any occurrence or set of circumstances involving actual or imminent physical trauma or property damage which demands immediate action. <br><em><br>Emergency vehicle</em> means vehicles of the fire, police and highway patrol departments and legally authorized ambulances and emergency vehicles of state departments. <br><em><br>Emergency work</em> means any work performed for the purpose of preventing or alleviating physical traumas or property damage threatened or caused by an emergency. <br><em><br>Excessive sound</em> means that sound level which elicits complaints, usually independent of each other in the estimate of the sound's being acceptable or unacceptable. <br><em><br>Gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)</em> means the value specified by the manufacturer as the recommended maximum loaded weight of a single motor vehicle. In cases where trailers and tractors are separable, the gross combination weight rating (GCWR), which is the value specified by the manufacturer as the recommended maximum loaded weight of the combination vehicle, shall be used. <br><em><br>Impulsive sound</em> means sound pulses of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. <br><em><br>L1 percentile level</em> means the time-averaged sound pressure level, A-weighted, that is exceeded in any time measurement period one percent of that time. <br><em><br>L10 percentile level</em> means the time-averaged sound pressure level, A-weighted, that is exceeded in any time measurement period ten percent of that time. <br><em><br>L90 percentile level</em> means the time-averaged sound pressure level, A-weighted, that is exceeded in any time measurement period 90 percent of that time. <br><em><br>Measurement period</em> means that total amount of time used in the measurement of sound levels for a given incident not including time intervals, or their total time, between intervals of actual sound measurement time. Limits are as stated herein, not less than ten minutes and not more than 30 minutes. <br><em><br>Motor vehicle</em> means every vehicle self-propelled on land and every vehicle propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not operated upon rails; provided, however, the definition of the term "motor vehicle" shall not include implements of husbandry. <br><em><br>Muffler</em> means a device for abating the sound of escaping gases of any internal combustion engine. <br><em><br>Noise</em> means any sound which annoys or disturbs humans or which causes or tends to cause an adverse psychological or physiological effect on humans. <br><em><br>Noise disturbance</em> means any plainly audible sound which:<ol><li>Injures or endangers the safety or health of a human;</li><li>Annoys or disturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities; or</li><li>Endangers or injures personal or real property.</li></ol>For the purpose of this definition, the term "plainly audible" means where the listener clearly can hear the content of the sound produced by the noise source.

A public place shall include, but not be limited to, any store, shop, restaurant, tavern, bowling alley, cafe, theater, drug store, pool room, shopping center and any other place devoted to amusement or entertainment of the general public. It shall also include the front or immediate area of the above. <br><em><br>Remain</em> means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. <br><em><br>Street</em> means a way or place, of whatsoever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term "street" includes the legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway or traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. <br><em><br>Time of night</em> referred to here is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public. <br><em><br>Year of age</em> continues from one birthday, such as the 17th to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase "under 18 years of age."</li><li>It shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age (under 18) to be or remain in or upon the streets or public places within the city at night during the period ending 5:00 a.m. and beginning:<ol><li>At 11:00 p.m. for minors on Sunday through Thursday; and</li><li>At 1:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and Sunday morning for minors.</li></ol></li><li>In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a city street or in a public place during the nocturnal hours for which this section is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation does not constitute a violation of the curfew regulations:<ol><li>When accompanied by a parent of such minor;</li><li>When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take the parent's place accompanying the minor for a designated period of time, date and purpose within a specified area. The authorized adult shall possess a written communication signed by the minor and countersigned by the parent/legal guardian of such minor which includes their home address and telephone number. The authorized adult shall have this communication from the minor's parent/guardian in his possession;</li><li>When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by possessing a written communication, signed by such minor and countersigned by a parent or legal guardian of such minor with their home address and telephone number, specifying times and dates when, and where, and in what manner the minor will be on the streets and other public places at night (during hours when the curfew regulations are otherwise applicable to the minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication;</li><li>The minor is on an errand, specific business or activity of an emergency nature directed or permitted by his parent;</li><li>If the minor has in the minor's possession a written communication signed by the minor and countersigned by a parent or legal guardian of such minor evidencing their home address and telephone number, and establishing such reason relating to a direct route for a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination. Each communication will also note the date and time limits the reason will encompass;</li><li>When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer;</li><li>When returning home, by a direct route, from (and within 45 minutes of the termination of) a school activity, or an activity of a religious or the voluntary association, provided the minor has a written communication in the minor's possession, countersigned by the parent or legal guardian indicating the home address and telephone number, the purpose for the event, and when, where and in what manner the minor will be on the streets at night;</li><li>Upon being petitioned, the city council may authorize by regulation a relaxation of the curfew in other matters of reasonable necessity and is determined to be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of these curfew regulations. Normally, such regulation by the city council permitting use of the streets or public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate notification of agencies, such as the schools, and the media when appropriate. The regulation shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets or public places permitted, and the period of time involved, not to extend more than 45 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity;</li><li>When the minor is within the scope of his employment and carries a certified card or some other form indicating employment, briefly identifying the minor, the addresses and telephone numbers of his home and his place of employment and his hours of employment or carries a valid proof of employment; or</li><li>Whenever the minor is engaged in interstate or intrastate vehicular travel with consent of his parent or legal guardian. This contemplates normal travel and clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement through the city, particularly on normal routes.</li></ol></li><li>It shall be unlawful for a parent, or other person, having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit, or by inefficient control to allow, such a minor to be or remain upon any city street or public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, the curfew regulations. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent, or legal guardian, should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's or person's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents or legal guardians up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor.</li><li>A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the curfew regulations, normally shall take the minor to the city police station, or other place designated by the chief of police, where a parent, or legal guardian, shall immediately be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they may be questioned about the necessary facts constituting a violation of these regulations. In the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the municipal court shall cause to be personally delivered or, by certified mail, sent to a parent, or legal guardian, written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of the curfew regulations, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.</li><li>If, after the warning notice pursuant to subsection (E) of this section of a first violation by a minor, a parent or legal guardian violates the section (in connection with a second violation by the minor), this shall be treated as an offense by the parent or legal guardian. The penalty, upon a plea of guilty, nolo contendere, or finding of guilt, shall be punished as provided in section 1-108, or a term of community service.</li></ol><p>(Code 1999, § 10-505; Ord.

A copy of the contractor's certificate of liability insurance shall be filed with the application and shall be not less than $500,000.00. Any insurance company issuing a liability policy to a contractor pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be required to notify the city in the event such liability policy is cancelled for any reason or lapses for nonpayment of premiums. In addition, the contractor shall submit proof that the contractor has secured workers' compensation coverage satisfactory under the Workers' Compensation Act, or an affidavit of exemption or self-insurance as authorized pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act. If the city deems it appropriate or necessary, the city may also require other information to be included on the application form to assist the city in registering the person as a contractor. The application shall contain statements that the applicant desires the issuance of a contractor registration certificate; that the applicant will comply with the provisions of this chapter; that the applicant will comply with state laws and local ordinances relating to standards and permits; that the applicant has or has not been registered or licensed as a contractor in another state and whether any disciplinary action was taken against such registration or license or whether it is still in good standing; and that the nonresident applicant appoints the secretary of state as legal service agent for all lawful process to be served upon the applicant for work performed in the state or as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
</li><li>The city shall refuse to register any person if the city determines: 
<ol><li>The application contains false, misleading, or incomplete information; 
</li><li>The applicant fails or refuses to provide any information requested by the city; 
</li><li>The applicant fails or refuses to pay the required fees; 
</li><li>The applicant is ineligible for registration due to a suspended or revoked registration in the state; 
</li><li>The nonresident applicant has a revoked or suspended registration or license required by law for contractors in another state; or 
</li><li>The applicant has failed or refuses to submit any taxes due in the state. 
</li></ol></li><li>The city shall notify the applicant in writing if the city denies a registration or renewal certificate, and shall provide the applicant an opportunity to respond to or cure any defect in the written application or renewal for a period of ten days from the date of the written notification. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the city denying a registration or renewal may appeal the decision to the city manager as provided in the Administrative Procedures Act, or the applicant may reapply after a 90-day waiting period, if otherwise eligible in the provisions of this chapter. The application and renewal fees shall not be refundable. 
</li><li>The city shall classify as not in good standing the registration of any contractor who fails to: 
<ol><li>Maintain liability insurance coverage; 
</li><li>Maintain workers' compensation coverage satisfactory under the Workers' Compensation Act, or provide an affidavit of exemption or self-insurance as authorized pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act; 
</li><li>File, renew, or properly amend any fictitious name certificate; 
</li><li>Maintain an active status of a corporation or registration as a foreign corporation, a limited liability company or registration as a foreign limited liability company, a limited liability partnership registration or foreign limited liability partnership registration, or a limited partnership certificate or limited partnership or foreign limited partnership certificate of authority, with the office of the secretary of state; 
</li><li>File or renew a trade name registration; 
</li><li>Maintain or renew a contractor registration as provided in this chapter; 
</li><li>Notify the city of a change in name, address, legal business entity, or legal service agent; 
</li><li>Maintain a registration as required by law in another state while registered in the state as a nonresident contractor; or 
</li><li>File and pay all taxes when due in the state. 
</li></ol></li><li>The city shall send a written notice to the person when his registration is not in good standing. Any contractor who has been notified by the city that his registration is not in good standing shall cease soliciting or entering new services and projects as of the date of such notification; however, the contractor shall be allowed to complete projects where actual physical work has begun prior to the date of issuance of the notice that his registration is not in good standing. If the contractor fails to correct the deficiency specified in the notice by evidence satisfactory to the registrar within 30 days of the date of the notice, or if the contractor solicits or enters into new services contracts or projects while the contractor's registration is not in good standing, or while such registration is suspended or revoked, the contractor shall be in violation of the provisions of this chapter. Any registration that remains not in good standing for a 60-day period shall be suspended on the 60th day from the date of issuance of the notice to the contractor that his registration is not in good standing. Any registration that remains not in good standing, and is suspended for such cause, shall be revoked on the 90th day from the date of issuance of the notice to the contractor that his registration is not in good standing. The city shall notify the contractor upon suspension or revocation of his registration for failure to comply in bringing such registration into good standing as required by law. The contractor may reinstate his registration to good standing by paying the required fees provided in section 14-308 and complying with all other requirements for issuance of a registration in good standing. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city to suspend or revoke a registration pursuant to this section may appeal such decision to the city manager's office.

<ol><li>A child under four years of age shall be properly secured in a child passenger restraint system. The child passenger restraint system shall be rear-facing until the child reaches two years of age or until the child reaches the weight or height limit of the rear-facing child passenger restraint system, whichever occurs first.

</li><li>A violation of the provisions of this section shall not be admissible as evidence in any civil action or proceeding for damages. In any action brought by or on behalf of an infant for personal injuries or wrongful death sustained by motor vehicle collision, the failure of any person to have the infant properly restrained in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not be used in aggravation or mitigation of damages. 
</li><li>Any person convicted of violating this section shall be punished by a fine of $50.00, or the maximum amount allowed by state law, whichever is greater, and shall pay court costs.

However, if the City no longer desires to acquire the System after its value is determined, the City may, without penalty or waiver of future rights to acquire the System, abandon its intention to acquire the System. The cost of the appraisal shall be shared equally between the City and Franchisee.

All sums due from Grantee shall be in lieu of all other franchise, license, or occupational taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City.</li><li>In the event that Grantor, pursuant to Paragraph 3.B(1) of this ordinance, requires persons transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff Arrangement to pay compensation to Grantor for use of the Public Ways in connection the sale of Transport Gas, said compensation shall be calculated as a Volumetric Rate fee for such Transport Gas, which shall be the sum equal to the then current Volumetric Rate multiplied by the number of Dth of Transport Gas reported or distributed through Grantee’s facilities within the municipal corporate limits of the City by Grantee or by any third-party to transport customers for consumption within the City.  Grantee will in that event collect such Volumetric Rate Fees from persons transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff Arrangement and remit the same to Grantor.</li></ol></li><li>In the event a customer of Grantee does not pay a monthly bill from Grantee in full, Grantee shall prorate its payments of remissions to the City for sums due on that particular bill so that the amount actually paid by the customer to Grantee on the bill is distributed to Grantee for the natural gas commodity and transportation or distribution service and to the City for sums due on the bill in proportion to the percentage of the total bill actually paid by the customer. In the event Grantee actually collects any outstanding amounts due on a past due, unpaid or partially paid monthly bill to a customer, then Grantee shall pay Grantor its proportionate share of sums due to the City on such bill.</li><li>Grantee’s franchise fee based upon a percentage of gross cash receipts or a volumetric rate shall be payable monthly on or before the 25th day of each month, on its gross cash receipts for the preceding calendar month.</li><li>All sums due from Grantee under this Section shall be in lieu of all other franchise, license, or occupation taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City.</li><li>The City’s chief administrative officer or his designee may waive the Volumetric Rate Fee or any part thereof due from a Transport Gas Consumer, but such waiver shall only be granted if:<ol><li>The Transport Gas Consumer could otherwise obtain its energy needs from another source that would not be subject to the fees imposed in Subparagraph 2 of Subsection 11.A above and sufficient evidence is produced by the Transport Gas Consumer so as to substantiate such alternative source; and</li><li>Such alternative source, including all other fees, would be less than the cost of utilizing Grantee to furnish and transport the gas or transport alone, as the case may be.</li></ol></li><li>Grantee shall update its records for the purpose of franchise fee payments as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice.</li><li>In the event the accounting rendered to Grantor by Grantee is found to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount, it being agreed that Grantor may accept amount offered by Grantee, but the acceptance thereof by Grantor shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or later found to be incorrect.  Grantee shall have no obligation, however, to make payment upon Transport Gas for which Grantee has not been paid.  Grantee shall provide notice to Grantor of such delinquent accounts within ninety (90) days and Grantor shall hold Grantee harmless from the cost or liability for the collection of franchise fees on such delinquent accounts.  </li><li>Grantor agrees that the franchise fee percentage rate set forth in Subsection 11.A, at Paragraphs (1) and (2), of this Ordinance shall in no event exceed the percentage rate hereafter approved to calculate any fee paid to Grantor by any other person or entity for use of the Public Ways if such fee or volumetric rate is based in any way on the amount of revenues or gross receipts from the transportation, distribution, or sale of natural gas or electric energy, excluding any municipally-owned electric utility, by such other person or entity to ultimate Consumers within the City.  If at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance the fee or rate required to be paid by another is less than the percentage rate set forth in Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of Section 11, then the percentage rate set forth in Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of Section 11 of this Ordinance shall be reduced to equal such lesser percentage rate on the date such lesser percentage rate becomes effective and without any further action by the City or the qualified electors residing therein.
