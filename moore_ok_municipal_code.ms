.LP
The Municipal Code of the City of Moore, OK began in-­house in 2020 with
the assistance of Municipal Code Corporation.
This City Code shall be cited as Moore City Code or \[lq]MCC\[rq] as an
acronym.
MCC references found within the code maintain a structure by subject
matter using a decimal and hyphenated numbering system which identifies
the chapter and section (\f[B]example: 1-101.01\f[R]).
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching and/or
referencing the Municipal Code, and to assist in subsequent codification
is new ordinances are added to the Municipal Code.
.IP \[bu] 3
The first number in the sequence designates the \f[B]PART\f[R] level
.IP \[bu] 3
The second series of numbers (\f[B]1\f[R]-101) designates the
\f[B]CHAPTER\f[R] level
.IP \[bu] 3
The third series of numbers (1-\f[B]101\f[R]) designates the
\f[B]Section\f[R] level
.IP \[bu] 3
If a fourth series exists comprising letters or numbers beyond the
section level, it designates a \f[B]Subsection\f[R] level.
.LP
To outline, give structure, and more granularly reference the
legislation herein, the following list order (or pattern of ascending
alphanumeric characters) is used: \f[B](a), (1), a, 1, i\f[R].
Drafting legislation with this list order better reconciles the content
in local software and hard copies, with the content in this online code.
The legislative history beneath a legislation\[cq]s content identifies
the specific legal sources, and may be provided to substantiate the
online code.
.PP
The Municipal Code is supplemented from time­ to ­time with amendments and
additions made by Moore, Oklahoma.
The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been
adopted during the codification process from the original formatting of
the official hard copy.
In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the
official hard copy, the official hard copy governs.
Municipal Code Corporation, provides a searchable database of the
Municipal Code for easy reference and convenience.
NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT
VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE
UPDATED ONLINE.
IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN
ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS.
ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS
PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL
SPECIFICATIONS.

Purpose.
The intent of this section is to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the community and its wildlife by prohibiting the feeding of wild
animals and waterfowl on public and private property within the
corporate limits of the City of Moore.
The feeding of waterfowl and other wild animals increases the potential
for damage to public parks and private property.
It also elevates the potential for the spread of disease in people and
companion animals.
In addition, it is the intent of this section to protect the welfare of
the waterfowl and wild animals themselves.
Wildlife studies have shown that feeding waterfowl and other wild
animals can interrupt their normal migration patterns, can make them
more aggressive in demanding food, cause nutritional problems, expose
them and our citizens to danger by eliminating the animals\[cq] natural
fear of predators, and promote the spread of diseases and
disease-carrying parasites.\

under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient
particularity the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be
unduly onerous, or for other good reason.

nonresident contractor as defined by this chapter, by signing and filing
the application, appoints the secretary of state as the applicant\[aq]s
true and lawful agent upon whom may be served all lawful process in any
action or proceeding against such nonresident contractor for
construction projects performed in the state.
Such appointment in writing is evidence of the roofing contractor\[aq]s
consent that any such process against the contractor which is served
upon the secretary of state shall be of the same legal force and effect
as if served upon the contractor personally within the state.
Registered foreign corporations, registered foreign limited liability
companies, foreign limited liability partnerships and foreign limited
partnerships entitled to do business in the state having a current
registered agent and registered address on file in the office of the
secretary of state need not appoint the secretary of state as agent for
service of process under this section.
Within ten days after service of the summons upon the secretary of
state, notice of such service with the summons and complaint in the
action shall be sent to the defendant roofing contractor at the
defendant contractor\[aq]s last-known address by registered or certified
mail with return receipt requested and proof of such mailing shall be
attached to the summons.
The secretary of state shall keep a record of all process served upon
the secretary of state under this section, showing the day and hour of
service.
Whenever service of process was made under this section, the court,
before entering a default judgment, or at any stage of the proceeding,
may order such continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant
contractor reasonable opportunity to defend any action pending against
the defendant contractor.

tax or penalties and interest due, or which may become due from such
operator.
In the event that the city clerk determines that an operator is to file
such bond, he shall give notice to such operator specifying the amount
of bond required.

.IP " 1." 4
Some nuisances are of such nature as to constitute a grave and immediate
danger to the peace, health, safety, morals or welfare of one or more
persons or of the public generally.
It is recognized that circumstances may be such as to justify, and even
to require, the city manager or other appropriate officer or agency of
the city government to take immediate and proper action summarily to
abate such nuisances or to reduce or suspend the danger until more
deliberate action can be taken toward such abatement.
.IP " 2." 4
An officer subordinate to the city manager may submit to the city
manager a statement as to the existence of a nuisance as defined by the
ordinances of the city or law, and a request or recommendation that it
be abated.
.IP " 3." 4
The city manager or his designee shall determine if a nuisance exists as
defined by the ordinances of the city or law.
If he finds that a nuisance does in fact exist, he shall direct the
owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance by:
.RS 4
.IP " 1." 4
Certified mail;
.IP " 2." 4
Publication if the owner cannot be so served or found;
.br
to abate the nuisance within a specified time if the peace, health,
safety, morals or welfare of the persons or public adversely affected
would not be unduly jeopardized by the consequent delay.
If such peace, health, safety, morals or welfare would be unduly
jeopardized by the consequent delay, or if the owner or other persons
responsible for or causing the nuisance do not abate it within the
specified time, or if the persons responsible authorize the city to
abate the nuisance, the manager shall direct the appropriate officer to
abate the nuisance or have it abated, if summary abatement is practical,
as authorized by 50 O.S.
§ 16.
The city shall send a statement of the cost of such summary abatement to
the owner or other persons responsible for or causing the nuisance, as
may be just under the circumstances, if their names and addresses are
known.
Until paid, such cost shall constitute a debt to the city collectible as
other debts may be collected.
.RE
.IP " 4." 4
The determination of the existence of a nuisance and order to abate it,
as made by the city manager, may be appealed by the occupant or owner or
person causing the nuisance by filing a request for hearing in writing

for abatement of the nuisance.
The clerk shall cause the matter to be placed on the agenda of the city
council for final determination with appropriate notice of the hearing
provided to the person requesting the appeal.

self-purification.
It is normally a relatively shallow, diked structure and may receive
either raw or pretreated wastes.
The satisfactory operation of the process depends upon the growth of
algae and like organisms for the production of oxygen through
photosynthesis; therefore, conditions must be maintained which are
conducive to the growth of algae, such as proper water depth, sufficient
dissolved oxygen, and maximum penetration of sunlight.

\&
.LP
After a building has been declared dilapidated as provided in this
chapter, and before the commencement of the tearing and removal of a
dilapidated building, the city may cause the building to be boarded and
secured in accordance with the following procedure.
The city may determine that a building is unsecured and order that such
building be boarded and secured in the manner provided for in this
section even though such building has not been declared by city to be
dilapidated.
.IP "  1." 5
Before the city orders such action, at least ten days\[aq] notice that
such unsecured building is to be boarded and secured shall be given by
mail to any property owners and mortgage holders as provided in section
8-303.
At the time of mailing of notice to any property owners or mortgage
holders, the city clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the
postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of the mailing and
the name and address of the mailee.
A copy of the notice shall also be posted on the property to be
affected.
However, if neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be
located, notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the
property or by publication as defined in 11 O.S.
§ 1-102.
Such notice shall be published one time, not less than ten days prior to
any hearing or action by the city pursuant to the provisions of this
section.
If the administrative officer anticipates summary abatement of a
nuisance in accordance with the provisions of this section, the notice
shall state that: any subsequent need for boarding and securing the
building within a six-month period after the initial boarding and
securing of the building pursuant to such notice may be summarily
boarded and secured by the city, that the costs of such boarding and
securing shall be assessed against the owner, and that a lien may be
imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without further
prior notice to the property owners or mortgage holders;
.IP "  2." 5
The owner of the property may give his written consent to the city
authorizing the boarding and securing of such unsecured building and to
the payment of any costs incurred thereby.
By giving the written consent, the owner waives his right to a hearing
as provided in this section;
.IP "  3." 5
If the property owner does not give his written consent to such actions,
a hearing may be held by the administrative officer to determine whether
the boarding and securing would promote and benefit the public health,
safety or welfare.
Such hearing may be held in conjunction with a hearing on the
accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or grass on the premises of
such unsecured building held pursuant to this Code.
In making such determination, the administrative officer shall apply the
following standard: the administrative officer may order the boarding
and securing of the unsecured building when the boarding and securing
thereof would make such building less available for transient
occupation, decrease a fire hazard created by such building, or decrease
the hazard that such building would constitute an attractive nuisance to
children.
Upon making such a determination, the administrative officer may order
the boarding and securing of the unsecured building;
.IP "  4." 5
After the administrative officer orders the boarding and securing of
such unsecured building, the city clerk shall immediately file a notice
of unsecured building and lien with the county clerk describing the
property, stating the findings of the city at the hearing at which the
building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the city
claims a lien on the property for the costs of boarding and securing the
building and that such costs are the personal obligation of the property
owner from and after the date of filing the notice;
.IP "  5." 5
Pursuant to the order of the administrative officer, the agents of the
city are granted the right of entry on the property for the performance
of the boarding and securing of such building and for the performance of
all necessary duties as a governmental function of the city;
.IP "  6." 5
After an unsecured building has been boarded and secured, the
administrative officer shall determine the actual costs of such actions
and any other expenses that may be necessary in conjunction therewith,
including the cost of the notice and mailing.
The city clerk shall forward a statement of the actual costs
attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured building and
a demand for payment of such costs by mail to any property owners and
mortgage holders as provided in section 8-303.
At the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property owners
or mortgage holders, the city clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing
from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate the date of
mailing and the name and address of the mailee;
.IP "  7." 5
If the city boards and secures any unsecured building, the cost to the
property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the labor, materials
and equipment required for the performance of such actions.
If such actions are done on a private contract basis, the contract shall
be awarded to the lowest and best bidder;
.IP "  8." 5
When payment is made to the city for costs incurred, the city clerk
shall file a release of lien, but if payment attributable to the actual
costs of the boarding and securing of the unsecured building is not made
within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the statement to the
owner of the property, the city clerk shall forward a certified
statement of the amount of the costs to the county treasurer of the
county in which the property is located.
The costs shall be levied on the property and collected by the county
treasurer as are other taxes authorized by law.
Until fully paid, the costs and the interest thereon shall be the
personal obligation of the property owner from and after the date the
notice of unsecured building and lien is filed with the county clerk.
The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and all
other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and superior to
all other titles and liens against the property, and shall continue
until the costs and interest are fully paid.
At any time prior to collection as provided herein, the city may pursue
any civil remedy for collection of the amount owing and interest
thereon, including an action in personam against the property owner and
an action in rem to foreclose its lien against the property.
A mineral interest if severed from the surface owner shall not be
subject to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this section.
Upon receipt of payment in full, the city clerk shall forward to the
county treasurer a notice of such payment and direct discharge of the
lien;
.IP "  9." 5
An appeal may be taken from the decision of the administrative officer
to the city council if filed in writing with the city clerk within ten
days after the administrative order is rendered;
.IP " 10." 5
If the city causes a structure to be boarded and secured, in accordance
with the procedures provided for in this section, any subsequent need
for boarding and securing the property within a six-month period may be
declared a nuisance and may be summarily abated without prior notice to
the property owner.
At the time of such summary abatement, the city clerk shall notify the
property owner of the boarding and securing and of the costs thereof.
The notice shall state that the property owner may request a hearing
within ten days from the date of mailing the notice.
The notice and hearing shall be as provided in this section.
Unless otherwise determined at the hearing, the cost of such abatement
shall be determined and collected as provided in this section.
This section shall not apply if the records of the county clerk show
that the property was transferred after notice was given pursuant to
this section.

The city declares that the city is in the early stages of a crisis,
which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten,
terrorize and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens
of this community.
These criminal activities, both individually and collectively, present a
clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not
constitutionally protected activities.
It is the intent of the city council to prohibit, reduce, and eradicate
criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal
activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs, which together
are the chief source of terror created by street gangs.

request the reasonable protection of proprietary information and to
provide redacted documents or require Grantor or its agents to enter
into such agreements pertaining to confidentiality as may reasonably
protect the proprietary information of Grantee but which do not
unreasonably frustrate the purposes of this Section.
Grantor shall promptly notify Grantee in writing of areas newly annexed
into or de-annexed from the corporate limits of Grantor, and Grantee
shall update its records for the purpose of payment of franchise fees as
soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice.

 -- "SECTION 11 CONSIDERATION FOR FRANCHISE: FRANCHISE FEE"
\&
.IP " 1." 4
In consideration for the rights and privileges enjoyed under this
franchise, Grantee agrees to pay Grantor as follows:
.RS 4
.IP " 1." 4
Grantee shall pay Grantor a franchise fee the sum of which is equal to
Three Percent (3%) of the Gross Receipts received by Grantee, per
billing period, from the transportation, distribution, and sale of
natural gas for domestic, commercial or industrial consumption within
the municipal corporate limits of the City.
All sums due from Grantee shall be in lieu of all other franchise,
license, or occupational taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted
to be levied on Grantee by the City.
.IP " 2." 4
In the event that Grantor, pursuant to Paragraph 3.B(1) of this
ordinance, requires persons transporting gas pursuant to a
Transportation Tariff Arrangement to pay compensation to Grantor for use
of the Public Ways in connection the sale of Transport Gas, said
compensation shall be calculated as a Volumetric Rate fee for such
Transport Gas, which shall be the sum equal to the then current
Volumetric Rate multiplied by the number of Dth of Transport Gas
reported or distributed through Grantee\[cq]s facilities within the
municipal corporate limits of the City by Grantee or by any third-party
to transport customers for consumption within the City.
Grantee will in that event collect such Volumetric Rate Fees from
persons transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff Arrangement
and remit the same to Grantor.
.RE
.IP " 2." 4
In the event a customer of Grantee does not pay a monthly bill from
Grantee in full, Grantee shall prorate its payments of remissions to the
City for sums due on that particular bill so that the amount actually
paid by the customer to Grantee on the bill is distributed to Grantee
for the natural gas commodity and transportation or distribution service
and to the City for sums due on the bill in proportion to the percentage
of the total bill actually paid by the customer.
In the event Grantee actually collects any outstanding amounts due on a
past due, unpaid or partially paid monthly bill to a customer, then
Grantee shall pay Grantor its proportionate share of sums due to the
City on such bill.
.IP " 3." 4
Grantee\[cq]s franchise fee based upon a percentage of gross cash
receipts or a volumetric rate shall be payable monthly on or before the
25th day of each month, on its gross cash receipts for the preceding
calendar month.
.IP " 4." 4
All sums due from Grantee under this Section shall be in lieu of all
other franchise, license, or occupation taxes or fees, which may be
levied or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City.
.IP " 5." 4
The City\[cq]s chief administrative officer or his designee may waive
the Volumetric Rate Fee or any part thereof due from a Transport Gas
Consumer, but such waiver shall only be granted if:
.RS 4
.IP " 1." 4
The Transport Gas Consumer could otherwise obtain its energy needs from
another source that would not be subject to the fees imposed in
Subparagraph 2 of Subsection 11.A above and sufficient evidence is
produced by the Transport Gas Consumer so as to substantiate such
alternative source; and
.IP " 2." 4
Such alternative source, including all other fees, would be less than
the cost of utilizing Grantee to furnish and transport the gas or
transport alone, as the case may be.
.RE
.IP " 6." 4
Grantee shall update its records for the purpose of franchise fee
payments as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice.
.IP " 7." 4
In the event the accounting rendered to Grantor by Grantee is found to
be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount, it
being agreed that Grantor may accept amount offered by Grantee, but the
acceptance thereof by Grantor shall not be deemed a settlement of such
item if the amount is in dispute or later found to be incorrect.
Grantee shall have no obligation, however, to make payment upon
Transport Gas for which Grantee has not been paid.
Grantee shall provide notice to Grantor of such delinquent accounts
within ninety (90) days and Grantor shall hold Grantee harmless from the
cost or liability for the collection of franchise fees on such
delinquent accounts.
.IP " 8." 4
Grantor agrees that the franchise fee percentage rate set forth in
Subsection 11.A, at Paragraphs (1) and (2), of this Ordinance shall in
no event exceed the percentage rate hereafter approved to calculate any
fee paid to Grantor by any other person or entity for use of the Public
Ways if such fee or volumetric rate is based in any way on the amount of
revenues or gross receipts from the transportation, distribution, or
sale of natural gas or electric energy, excluding any municipally-owned
electric utility, by such other person or entity to ultimate Consumers
within the City.
If at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance the fee or
rate required to be paid by another is less than the percentage rate set
forth in Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of Section 11, then the percentage rate
set forth in Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of Section 11 of this Ordinance
shall be reduced to equal such lesser percentage rate on the date such
lesser percentage rate becomes effective and without any further action
by the City or the qualified electors residing therein.
